# AbstractionVsEncapsulation
Basic Example to show the difference between Abstraction and Encapsulation
Differences between these two core concepts of OOPS are explained here https://taagung.com/differences-between-abstraction-and-encapsulation/
Extract on concept
As we can see, Our consumer class Class has one method ExecuteProject(IProject project). At this points, this method doesnâ€™t know what type of project it will be executing as it just expects IProject. That is again abstraction.

In Actual class implementation, we have few methods to get the work done. That may, in turn, call another method to have specific execution. So hiding of internal working of waterfall and agile project documentation and programming showcase the concept id encapsulation.
